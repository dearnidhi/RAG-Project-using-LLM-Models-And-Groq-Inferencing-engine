command to run code:- streamlit run app.py

A well-structured Streamlit application for a question-answering system using Groq and OpenAI embeddings. 
Here are some aspects you within this projec

1. Functionality:

Describe the application's purpose: It's a question-answering system that retrieves relevant information from loaded web documents and uses Groq to answer user prompts based on that context.
2. Components:

Explain the key components:
Web document loader: Fetches documents from a specified URL (e.g., "https://docs.smith.langchain.com/").
Text splitter: Breaks down large documents into smaller chunks for better processing.
FAISS index: Enables efficient retrieval of similar documents based on their embeddings.
OpenAI embeddings: Generates vector representations of text for document similarity.
ChatGroq model: Interacts with the Groq large language model for answering questions.
Chat prompt template: Defines the format for presenting context and questions to Groq.
Retrieval chain: Combines document retrieval and interaction with Groq.
3. Streamlit Integration:

Explain how Streamlit is used to create a user interface:
Displays a title ("ChatGroq Demo").
Provides a text input field for users to enter their prompts.
Shows the retrieved answer from Groq.
Offers an expandable section for displaying relevant document snippets.
4.  Execution Flow:

Describe the application's workflow:
Initializes session state variables on first run (embeddings, loader, documents, etc.).
Loads documents from the web and splits them into manageable chunks.
Creates a FAISS index for fast document retrieval based on similarity.
When the user enters a prompt:
Measures the processing time.
Uses the retrieval chain to find relevant document snippets based on the prompt.
Sends the context (relevant snippets) and questions to Groq for answer generation.
Displays the answer received from Groq.
Optionally shows the retrieved document snippets within an expandable section.
5. Customization:

You can document potential customizations:
Changing the web document source using st.session_state.loader = WebBaseLoader("new_url").
Adjusting the document splitting parameters in RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Modifying the Chat prompt template (e.g., adding additional instructions for Groq).
